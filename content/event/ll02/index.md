PSYCHICEYECLIX

Plays with different equipment each performance - circuit bent/rewired games consoles/drum machines/synths, camcorders pointed at the audience glitched up. All his equipment is recycled. By rewiring old redundant equipment he circuit bends them into new and more exciting instruments. His live performance invokes entropy with visuals & audio that are continuously mutating and interacting.

FALL INTO DRY LUNGS

FALL INTO DRY LUNGS is the collaborative project of Christoph F. (Dry Lungs Records / Feuersalamander auf Marzipan) and Petar S. (Fall Into Void Recs / Bruising Pattern). Since its inception in early 2015 they have made a name for themselves for their high-energy pedal abusing live performances. Playing either as a noise&drums duo or delivering a cut-up battle style harsh noise set, whatever fits the venue, event & moment best! Their first release entitled "Occult Sacrifice" has been put out by Spain's Craneal Fracture Records and is soon to be followed by a double-cassette tape set amongst many other things!
