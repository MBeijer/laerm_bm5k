few lineup changes came up [LUI](https://soundcloud.com/exlepaeng/pangstoff018-lui-ballern) and [Oliotronix](https://soundcloud.com/oliotronix) cause of corona, [DJ Balli](https://sonicbelligeranza.com/) is not sure, so he is waiting for his test results. Sadly, [BAM]() also can´t make it, so we have now [Sepix](https://sepix.net/), [DJ Shinsekai](https://www.shinsekai.club/) and [DJ Juhuli (LIVE)](https://squash-im-europark.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/live.png) on board. Being a promoter during a pandemic is not easy, but [Captain Raveman](http://www.raveman.net/), [Melt Unit](https://www.meltunit.com/), [Null Hypothesis](https://linktr.ee/nullhypothesis) and [Fall Into Dry Lungs](https://fallinto.drylungs.at/) are still negative.

this is a good point to say, come tested, recovered or vaccinated on may the 14th. better safe than sorry, because it really sucks for the Artists not be able to play on shows, it sucks as promoter to find last minute another act, it sucks for the audience if act´s they like to see getting cancelled last min.

#### so please come tested, recovered or vaccinated, better come tested and recovered or vaccinated, so this can be a great party
